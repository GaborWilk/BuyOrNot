## Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior with Machine Learning Pipelines

**BuyOrNot** is a machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will make a purchase (it's generic, it could be a product, house, etc.) based on their demographics, using scikit-learn pipelines, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning. It is a binary classification problem, and basically the project gives an
answer to this question:
    Based on age, income, and gender, will this person make a purchase?

Where the output (purchased column) can be the following:
- 1 = the person purchased (something)
- 0 = the person did not purchase

It's designed for learning, experimentation, and potential real-world adaptation.

### Results

The generated purchase data contains almost equal amounts of yes and no values.

Final Model Accuracies:
- RandomForest: Accuracy = 0.7650
- GradientBoosting: Accuracy = 0.7550
- LogisticRegression: Accuracy = 0.8050
- SVC: Accuracy = 0.8150

**Best Model: SVC with Accuracy = 0.8150**

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BuyOrNot.git
cd BuyOrNot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

1. Train the model
```python
python src/train_model.py
```

2. Make predictions
```python
python src/predict.py
```

### Example Prediction

```python
new_person = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [35],
    'income': [70000],
    'gender': ['Female'],
    'education_level': ['PhD'],
    'marital_status': ['Single'],
    'children': [1],
    'job_type': ['Professional'],
    'previous_purchase': [0],
    'credit_score': [850],
    'interested_in_newsletter': [False]
})

prediction = model.predict(new_person)

# Prediction Result
# ========================
# Will the person purchase? â†’ Yes
# ========================
